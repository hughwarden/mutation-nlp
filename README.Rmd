# Trying to Classify Oncogenes from PubMED Abstracts

This is the repository containing the code I used for my blog post [Trying to Classify Oncogenes from PubMED Abstracts](https://hwarden.blog/posts/mutation-nlp/).

Apologies for the lack of commenting and package versions, this is something I would like to come back to if there is interest and I have the time.
